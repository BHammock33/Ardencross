The Boys all come together in a Tavern. We establish that Eileen owns the tavern and that it is not in the best shape. WE WILL MAKE IT IN WORSE SHAPE AT THE END OF THE BAR BRAWL FIGHT

**Beagan Notes: 

Bob wakes up from daydream to Eileen in nob’s tavern. He is in nobs because he brought a shipment of ale. Everyone was kicked in the head by a horse recently. 

Rasgar walks into town alone, comes through the “salt gate” Leads to the sea. We are **10 days from midsummer**. Needs to be away from the church right now. Meets Ravkul and walks with him through town to Nob’s tavern. Talks to Eileen 

Ivaldi is with Glaurunga who has something to show him. Parade is coming. “Hard to express smell through a page”. Silk sisters hunt monsters. Iron tower keeps people safe. Radiant vigilance are monster hunters? 

Dagnir is excited to speak with Ivaldi. Goes to knob’s tavern with Glaurunga. Hasn't had any drinks before. Reads too much

Fil is already in the tavern playing cards waiting for his person to meet him. Fire ginasee sits down with him named rusty. Sees bob talking to Eileen, rusty and I. Fil wins money and buys a round. Goes downstairs in the basement with rusty. Rusty says boss needs her interest taken care of. Raynard is looking for more bands to fight demons, promises fame. Needs to form a band to fight demons and will hear back from the boss after the band is formed. 

- Wramorn seems to be losing his way, Ravkul says. Wramorn was married and was gonna have a kid, something happened and he had to make a choice and chose to save his daughter but she’s not well. Wife died in childbirth. Ravkul and Rasgar want to set Wramorn back on track.
