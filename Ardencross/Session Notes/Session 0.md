Amnwater: pass through town

Characters:

                Luke: Bobaraz Dur (Bob Ross) former hill dwarf warrior, fought many battles. Starting over at the bottom. Barbarian, that joined a monastic tradition to get away from the violence, living the happy life. Eager to get out of the monastery and volunteer, wants to be a pacifist but the anger is in him. Lawful Good. Upper fifties, over the hill a little bit. Warring days weren’t great for him and his clan, doesn’t keep in contact with the clan.

                John: Evaldee chronology wizard, studying in candleekeep for a long time. Has not adventured, locked in hitting the books. No reason to leave while he was still learning, hit a plateau, needs to get out in the world to be taught about the real world. Wants to become the most powerful, wants to prove himself, naïve

                Tyler: Raskar Paladin, grew up in small town near icewindale, paladin for the church of Bahamut but comes from very rich family. Been out on some crusades, time to help others throughout the world. Just under middle aged, family still living Cushy life. Father is high up in his position in the church.  Bahamut: Lawful good, platinum dragon

Likes/Dislikes:

                No Guns and Cyborgs

                Loved the combat system (Mario party) move as group into small battles (Big City fight at the end)

                Luke favorite things: Being able to see repercussions of their actions, more evolving world things happening outside of your group. Using rolls outside of combat/non combat encounters

                Luike didn’t like: combat that lasts entire sessions, fucked over by the rabbit for the toll

                John: Roleplay took him out of it (setting issue), did like good variety in boss fights, throw shit and find out what works (combat mechanic tweaks like roper arms) like combat at walls but only sprinkled in

Want to come from separate backgrounds, spend some time up front to figure out their characters socially

Tyler likes just barely surviving over big swarms of enemies, look into MINION Rules, always the option of running away

Monastary in the Sunset Mountains, trappist monks, brewers thinkers, not super religious, philosophical, raise dogs “How to be your dogs best friend”
